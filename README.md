This is my portfolio. Since I don't have any live projects outside of HW I included some fun links to show that I have a functional site. I have responses on the acceptance criteria below along with the links and screenshots. 


GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio.
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
Completed.
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
Scroll functions are completed and active.
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
This is completed.
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
This is completed.
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
This is completed.
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

*Please note that because I have a Mac, my instructors/TA noticed that sometimes when I git push to my shared repo, certain files won't push accurately due to Mac not reading case sensitivity at times. We recently fixed this issue but if images/background do not load properly or some functionality is not working, PLEASE let me know.
